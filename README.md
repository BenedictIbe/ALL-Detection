# ALL-Detection
This repository provides an implementation for the detection and classification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project focuses on leveraging advanced image processing and model training to identify leukemia in microscopic blood smear images accurately.

# Features
- Data Preprocessing
  - Image normalization, resizing, and augmentation for robust model training.

- Deep Learning Models
  - Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
  - Support for pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or custom architectures).

- Evaluation Metrics
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix to assess model performance.

- Deployment
  - Model deployment pipeline for real-time leukemia detection from new samples.

# Getting Started
#Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: tensorflow, keras, opencv-python, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
- GPU setup (optional but recommended for faster model training).

# Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

# bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenedictIbe/ALL-Detection.git  
    cd ALL-Detection  

# Install Dependencies

# bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Prepare Dataset
  - Download a publicly available ALL dataset or use the dataset provided in the repository.
  - Place images in the data/ directory with appropriate subfolders for labeled classes (e.g., Healthy/ and Leukemic/).
  - Run the Training Script

# bash
    python train_model.py  

# Test the Model
Use the test script to evaluate the model on unseen data:

# bash
    python test_model.py  

# Project Workflow
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Load microscopic blood smear images.
- Normalize and augment images to improve model generalization.
- Model Training
- Train a CNN-based model to classify images into healthy or leukemic categories.
- Evaluate the model using validation data and fine-tune hyperparameters.

# Model Evaluation
- Use test data to compute accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
- Visualize results with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

# Deployment
- Save the trained model for real-time inference.
- Deploy using Flask or a similar framework for clinical use.

# Usage Examples
# Training the Model
Customize parameters in train_model.py and run the script:

# bash
    python train_model.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.001  

# Testing the Model
Provide the test data directory and run the script:

# bash
    python test_model.py --test_dir ./data/test/ --model_path ./models/cnn_model.h5  

# Inference on New Images
Use the deployed model to classify a single image:

# bash
    python predict.py --image_path ./data/sample.jpg --model_path ./models/cnn_model.h5  

# Results and Visualizations
- Model Performance:
    - Accuracy: 95%+ on test data.
    - F1-Score: High precision and recall for both classes.

# Plots and Insights:
  - Loss and accuracy curves during training.
  - Confusion matrix and classification reports for evaluation.
